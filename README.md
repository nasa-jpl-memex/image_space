ImageSpace
==========
ImageSpace is an application built on top of [ImageCat](http://github.com/chrismattmann/imagecat/)
that allows a user to browse a rich catalog of EXIF-metadata extracted and OCR extracted information
from images. It allows histogram and D3-based visual search, free text search and retrieval and 
performs image similarity metrics using computer vision techniques and metadata-techniques (e.g., 
[Jaccard Similarity](http://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-img-similarity)).

Quickstart
==========
ImageSpace can be spun up quickly by means of Docker containers, see the [ImageSpace Quickstart](https://github.com/memex-explorer/image_space/blob/master/scripts/deploy/README.md).

Image Similarity through [SMQTK](https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK) can be made available by following the [ImageSpace SMQTK Quickstart](https://github.com/memex-explorer/image_space/blob/master/imagespace_smqtk/Docker.md).

Installation
============
See the [installation README](https://github.com/memex-explorer/image_space/tree/master/imagespace) for
